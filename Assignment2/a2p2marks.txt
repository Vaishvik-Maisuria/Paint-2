		YN Factory used to return a strategy, installed strategy
			in paint panel.

Members: Each member is given a fraction of the total amount of work
	for the project. This is based on the userstories they worked on.
	If all members appeared to work the same amount, each gets 25% out of 100.
	So, if all members contribute equally, each gets 25/25.
