	Yesterday : Studying for CSC207 Midterm.
	Today     : Divide and prioritize user stories. Create branches for
				user stories. 
	Obstacles : Determining how to divide work and formulating time estimates.

Oct 28, 2017
	Yesterday : Divided and prioritized user stories. For the first sprint, 
				I will be handling the Square and Square Feedback user stories.
	Today     : Work on Square class.
	Obstacles : Figuring out how to start the square class.

Oct 29, 2017
	Yesterday : Created square class with methods getting and setting start
				and endpoints.
	Today     : Start writing code to draw square to screen.
	Obstacles :	Getting output to draw to screen, NullPointerExceptions seem
				to be popping up when ArrayList of squares is called.

Oct 30, 2017
	Yesterday : Started 'draw square code' but was unable to implement it
				fully. Will come back to this ASAP.
	Today     :	Rework Square class code to implement the new ShapeComponent
				interface (move some code from PaintPanel with slight
				modifications).
	Obstacles : Figuring out what changes to make to the code (particularly
				where to use 'this' and where to use 'g2d' in paint method).

Oct 31, 2017
	Yesterday : Implemented ShapeComponent interface to create a paint
				method within Square class.
	Today     : Day off.
	Obstacles :	N/A

Nov 1, 2017
	Yesterday : Took the day off.
	Today     : Get square drawing working. Finish User Story 9 Square 
				Feedback.
	Obstacles : https://mcs.utm.utoronto.ca/~263/dan_laugh.jpg
	
Nov 2, 2017
	Yesterday : Implemented Square and Square Feedback. However, this
				implementation is buggy: the square can be dragged around
				the screen while it is being drawn.
	Today     : Fix the aforementioned bug in Square Feedback.
	Obstacles :	Identifying the problem in the code causing the bug.
	
Nov 3, 2017
	Yesterday : Attempted to fix the drawing of Square by restructuring code:
				rather than having the Square class accept start and end as
				parameters, changed to start and sideLength. Reworked methods 
				to fit this new architecture. However, the bug still remains 
				but only along the x-axis (the entire square can no longer be 
				dragged upwards as before).
	Today     : Continue working on Square drawing, update Square class to
				fit with changes to model and 'isFilled' attribute.
	Obstacles : Reworking code to fit with changes to model.

Nov 4, 2017
	Yesterday : Updated Square class to work with changes to model and 
				'isFilled' attribute. Attempted to fix square drawing but
				the bug still remains.
	Today     : Due to another obligation I will not have much time to work
				today. Start on Bug 2 (clearly mark which shape drawing mode the user 
				is in).
	Obstacles : Making progress with limited time.

Nov 5, 2017
	Yesterday : Started working on Bug 2, was able to get button to
				turn green when pressed.
	Today     : Finish my fixes for Bug 2 (when another shape is selected, turn
				previous shape button's background back to grey) as well as
				square drawing.
	Obstacles : Redoing code in PaintPanel for SquareFeedback to account for
				cases when square is being drawn starting from top *right*
				corner.

Nov 6, 2017
	Yesterday : Fixed bugs in square drawing and completed the fix for Bug 2.
				Handed in the assignment.
	Today     : Read the A2P2 outline and marking scheme. Get familiar with the
				required user stories and come up with a general plan to implement
				them.
	Obstacles : Redoing code in PaintPanel for SquareFeedback to account for
				cases when square is being drawn starting from top *right*
				corner.
				
Nov 7, 2017
	Yesterday : Read the A2P2 outline and marking scheme. Decided on taking on
				Bug 2.4, will implement an interface ShapeManipulatorStrategy
				that will handle creation + movement of each shape.
	Today     : Day off - Statistics midterm, writing class meeting, 207 lecture...
				very hectic day. RIP Roy Halladay.
	Obstacles : N/A
				
Nov 8, 2017
	Yesterday : Day off.
	Today     : Start implementing ShapeManipulatorStrategy: the interface and
				implementations for each shape.
	Obstacles : Unable to test strategies at this point because Command
				Design Pattern has not been implemented in PaintPanel.
Nov 9, 2017
	Yesterday : Created ShapeManipulatorStrategy interface and completed
				CircleManipulatorStrategy & RectangleManipulatorStrategy.
	Today     : Rework architecture of ShapeManipulatorStrategy due to
				change in design pattern usage. Now take in MouseEvents.
	Obstacles : Refactoring existing codebase to be compatible with new design
				choices.
				
Nov 10, 2017
	Yesterday : Changed Strategies to respond to ActionEvents involving
				the mouse. Modified circle, rectangle strategies appropriately.
	Today     : Due to unexpected personal situation, will take today and
				tomorrow off.
	Obstacles : N/A
				
Nov 11, 2017
	Yesterday : Day off.
	Today     : Day off.
	Obstacles : N/A
				
Nov 12, 2017
	Yesterday : Day off.
	Today     : Now switched over to Bug 2.2: improving architecture for 
				handling shape modifiers. Create DrawingCommand classes that
				will be used in ShapeManipulatorStrategies.
	Obstacles : Familiarizing myself with parts of the codebase that I had not
				been working on, in order to complete this new bug.
				
Nov 13, 2017
	Yesterday : Attempted to implement DrawingCommand classes, but had errors
				when drawing filled polygons.
	Today     : Finish Bug 2.2: fix the error causing filled polygons to crash
				the program.
	Obstacles : Our polyline implementation is still undergoing changes: 
				may have to change DrawingCommand/Manipulator code on the fly.
				
Nov 14, 2017
	Yesterday : Implemented filled polygon drawing by passing isFilled variable
				from the panel into the DrawingCommand using a getter function.
	Today     : Add finishing touches to program: modify fill/outline button
				to be a checkbox for easier use, add more information to slider
				(User Stories 30, 31)
	Obstacles : Using unfamiliar Java packages, time constraints due to
				impending deadline.
